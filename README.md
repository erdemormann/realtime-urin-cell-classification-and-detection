# REAL-TIME CLASSIFICATION AND DETECTION OF URINE CELLS ON IMAGES WITH YOLO

This project focuses on analyzing urine cells in the medical imaging domain. Utilizing a dataset obtained from microscopic images, it aims to provide real-time detection, classification, and health status information regarding urine cells using the YOLO algorithm. The YOLO algorithm stands out as a fast and accurate method for object detection, being the preferred method in this project.

The detected cells include **Bacteria, Other, Epithelial, Erythrocyte, Crystal, Leukocyte, Yeast, and Cylinder.** Evaluations were conducted on YOLO algorithm versions yolov6, yolov7, and yolov8, with the **best performance achieved by the yolov8 large version, reaching an 85% success rate.**

**Numerical distribution of microscopic images of urine cells in the dataset**
